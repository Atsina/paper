=The Canonical Debate.=

A proposal to fix the current state of online discourse through the promotion of fact-based reasoning, and the accumulation of human knowledge, brought to you by the Canonical Debate Lab, a community project of the [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation].

==i. Abstract.==

Thomas Jefferson once said, "The cornerstone of democracy rests on the foundation of an educated electorate." We are living in the Internet Era, where information should be more available and abundant than ever, and yet it has also been said that we are now living in an era of "Post-Truth." We at The Canonical Debate Lab believe it is time to take the power away from the hands of elected representatives, and place it finally where it belongs, in the hands of the public. However, in order for this to be successful, we must ensure that the citizens of the world have all the information they need to make the right choices for themselves, and to make sure that this information has been validated to the maximum extent possible. Although some may say that the Internet is "broken", we believe that the problem is a structural one, and thus one that can be fixed. In this white paper, we define what we believe to be the missing piece to the Internet: a canonical debate, a place online where individuals with different opinions can come together, rather than apart, to debate and discuss openly and constructively the issues that face them, to propose solutions for these problems, analyze the trade offs and choose the one that best suits their needs. This tool reverses many of the natural incentives of other social networks that have led to information bubbles, clickbait headlines, sensationalist journalism, and "fake news." We believe that with this tool, we can finally fulfill the promise that was given with the rise of the Internet.

==ii. Contents.==

This document describes our vision for online debates and decision making in several parts, first from a conceptual and philosophical level, followed by a detailed description of our proposed solution for this vision:

* [[#Problems|Problems]]: Provides an overview of the current state of debate and discourse online, and where we see a need for improvement.

* [[#Principles|Principles]]: The fundamental principles upon which our solution is built.

* [[#Solution|Solution]]: Our proposal for a new platform upon which intelligent decisions can be constructed in collaboration with one another.

This document is hosted as a living document of the group's high-level vision. It is meant to evolve over time in concert with the ideas and goals of the organization. The project, and this document, are an open source effort, and we welcome all to participate.

==1. Problems.==

Once upon a time, there was the optimistic belief that the Internet would bring about an era of enlightenment, peace and unprecedented productivity. The technological and logistic advances that came with this new era permit access to information in a capacity never before experienced by humans, and modes of instantaneous and asynchronous communication between people that were science fiction only decades before. These structural changes were supposed to eradicate the problem of human ignorance, and bring people around the world together in h higher levels of mutual understanding and cooperation.

So, what happened? More than 20 years after the dawn of the World Wide Web, The Oxford Dictionary declared "[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2016 post-truth]" as its world of the year. This year also heralded a major shift in world politics towards nationalistic, isolationist trends, and become common practice to categorize information which one considers displeasing as "fake news".

The state of debate and collective deliberation, both online and off, appears to have taken a major step backwards since the dawn of the Internet. We of the Canonical Debate Lab believe, however, that all is not lost. We believe that the problem is structural in nature, and therefore can be solved with a structural fix.

===1.1 The Problem With Debate Online.===

The state of debate as it occurs via the available suite of "online" tools is particularly disappointing. None of the technologies in use today (with the exception of email and a few others) were available twenty years ago, and yet with this incredible growth in capability, we have failed to address fundamental issues with deliberation, and created many new ones.

'''''Debates are scattered'''''

As in the pre-Internet era, there is no one place to look for information regarding a single topic of debate. It requires more work than the average person is willing to do to collect all the relevant information. Given the overhead involved in a task as small as verifying the facts behind even a single news article, no single person can ever hope to gain a complete understanding of our most complex and important issues.

'''''Arguments are made in silos'''''

Rather than responding point by point to each argument, online debate is generally executed in long form, where a single person or group offers a complete set of opinions on a single, or possibly multiple subjects. This format makes it nearly impossible for one side to completely address the points of the other side, and gives leeway to gloss over them with only a superficial treatment, or even ignore them completely. As such, it is difficult to every fully resolve the case regarding even a single fact. It also enables many fallacies, such as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man Strawman Fallacy] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking Cherry Picking].

'''''Effort is wasted in repetition'''''

Because debates are held in multiple places, with multiple overlapping, incomplete sets of of information at varying levels of specificity, accuracy and truth, most of effort in debate is wasted in repetition. There is currently no efficient way to "onboard" newcomers to the debate with the accumulated set of information that has been discussed. More knowledgeable participants must inevitably answer the same questions multiple times, and rebut arguments that have been made to them before, with no way to resolve a question [https://theflatearthsociety.org/home/ once and for all].

'''''Models promote polarization'''''

Trends in the polarization of political opinion have been traced back in large degree to current models of online discussion and information sources, which increase engagement by way of learning user preferences, and giving them more of the same. The result is what's known as information bubbles, or echo chambers, in which people rarely come into contact with information or opinions contrary to the user's own. 

This trend to some degree seems to be an unexpected negative consequence of the ability of the individual to choose between multiple sources of information, and so can be traced prior to the internet to other events, such as the proliferation of opinionated news channels on cable TV. The Internet has certainly exacerbated the situation, giving the uncountable options of information platforms available.

Recent studies have shown how such one-sided interactions lead to increasing radicalization of opinions, as people encounter a wide variety of opinions of varying extremes, but all biased towards one side of the debate. Unfortunately, this problem appears to be an essential part of the structure and business model of most information sources online:

* In order to compete, news sites find it advantageous to carve out a niche by adopting a consistent editorial slant.
* Social media sites encourage users to improve their experience by organizing into groups of people with shared interest and opinions.
* Ad-driven business models find success in giving users more of what they want, rather than showing them something that will upset them.
* Superficial, entertaining, and sensationalist reporting generally gets more attention (and gives better financial returns) than balanced, information-rich text.

'''''Trolling is rewarded'''''

Many Internet destinations which encourage interaction with the public do so in a format that favors "trolling" or "flame bait": flippant remarks designed to insult or enrage readers, or to get a cheap laugh, without substantially advancing the conversation. Comments sections in news and video sites, as well as most unmoderated forums, are notorious for this problem, resulting in a perverse circus-like competition of comments which often cross the line to hate speech. Many news sites have chosen to turn off public comments entirely, and it is a common joke that "the comments section may be hazardous to your health."

Microblog formats, like Twitter, do better in some respects, but suffer from similar problems, though in less concentrated doses. The brief format works best for sound bites, quick jokes, or off-the-cuff opinions, rather than deep and detailed reasoning. The fully public nature of the platform, coupled with the incentive to gain "followers" and "likes", rewards phrasing and entertainment value at least as much as the ideas that are being represented. Twitter icons like Ann Coulter have mastered the technique of retrying the same comment or joke multiple times until it has reached the right pitch of phrasing, humor and controversy to "go viral". This is a necessary skill that unfortunately not many scientists, field experts or deep thinkers possess.

Research into the psychology of online trolling has found that there is a notably sadistic tendency to those which exhibit this behavior. Their intention is specifically to cause some form of emotional harm to their readers, who have no reasonable recourse other than try to ignore such comments. A direct response only worsens the situation, giving more opportunity for the troll to insult or enrage the reader. It is unfortunate, then, that most sites do not have enough resources nor the proper structure to moderate open conversation. Trolls are thus given a much louder voice than those with more moderate tendencies, leading to the misperception that the majority of people in the world have [https://www.facebook.com/Million-Moderate-March-161343150543101/ extreme and insulting opinions]. 

'''''Debate is tied to reputation'''''

When a controversial issue is discussed online in an official capacity, rather than anonymously or pseudonymously, it means the arguments being made are tied to a person or entity with a reputation to establish and maintain. This creates a bias in the arguments that can be made. In order to expand human knowledge and make the best decisions, it is necessary to confront all possibilities, no matter how controversial they may at first seem. Unfortunately, public entities reasonably fear making unpopular arguments, or alienating their supporters or readers. 

Exploratory arguments are especially dangerous, in that they may be misunderstood or taken (intentionally or unintentionally) out of context. Online, it can be very difficult to establish a safe place for "blue sky" thinking, or using the brainstorming practice of gathering all possible ideas free from any evaluation so that the best ideas may then be selected. It would be easy for casual readers to mistake fanciful out-of-the-box ideas as the actual opinions of the person expressing them.

While this may appear to be an insignificant issue, there is an exaggerated danger online of reputational damage that can be very difficult to undo. Many people have [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/your-money/speaking-about-politics-can-cost-you-your-job.html lost their job] expressing an unpopular opinion online. The cartoonist Scott Adams was labeled a misogynist (correctly or not) for posting thought experiments on his blog, prompting him to preface many of his subsequent posts with a [http://blog.dilbert.com/2011/11/09/cains-inexplicably-high-polling/ disclaimer]. More recently, the author and podcaster Sam Harris dared to discuss with an open mind the controversial research of Charles Murray and found himself placed on [https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/987378512813219840 a list of racist leaders]. There is a very real risk in tackling controversy online, with very little chance of recovering from reputational damage.

'''''Experts are drowned out'''''

One of the great achievements of the internet is the extent to which it has enabled just about anyone to join in on the global conversation, to publish writings and opinions with little to no cost and effort. The internet can be compared to the revolution created by the Gutenberg printing press in terms of its impacts on communications and society. 

Unfortunately, quantity is not the same thing as quality. While it is much easier to find some amount of information on just about anything, there are few mechanisms in place for selecting based on quality and depth.

Especially in the case of real-time news, it is much easier to get a sense of general popular opinion (or at least, the popular opinion within your self-selected information bubble) than it is to find the most accurate or relevant information. When experts are interviewed, the content is superficial and more opinion-rich than information-rich. 

Real information is commonly buried in academic papers, and primary sources are hard to find. The format and language used by experts is generally too dense and erudite to be useful to the average person.

'''''Debates can be "hacked"'''''

As difficult as it may be with the cacophony of superficial opinions to find a vein of expert and verified information, the problem can easily be exacerbated by those who do not want the truth to be known. Through use of bots, fake accounts and other guerrilla marketing techniques the online debate can be swayed by a false sense of popularity for otherwise unfounded positions.

Such were the findings of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, which found that a Russian agency was created specifically to sew distrust and division in the U.S. via [https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-05-10/lawmakers-release-thousands-of-russian-facebook-ads online ads]. Networks of fake accounts were also used to promote falsified information that would also increase the internal strife. While politicians may label "fake news" as [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/trump-admits-he-calls-all-negative-news-fake.html anything with which they do not agree], there is a real threat of sophisticated attacks on our online information systems which are intended to promote false versions of the truth.

===1.2 The Problem With Debate Offline.===

'''''Not enough time'''''

When a topic is important enough to debate with another person, there are usually multiple arguments on either side that must be considered. Each argument must be based on one or more facts that to their own merit may require justification, and so on. In-person debates, whether between an informal group of people, or formally presented and moderated in front of an audience, are too short to cover all the relevant points, to the final level of detail. 

Live debates can only be an approximation of the whole picture. Take, for example, the formal structure of Oxford-style debates:

# One member of the team in support of the "motion" makes their case, to the best of their ability, in favor of the topic under discussion, within a given time limit.
# A panelist from the side opposing the motion gets their chance to make the case against the statement within the time limit given.
# This continues for each pair of additional panelists.
# There is a limited question-and-response segment in which participants, moderators and/or observers can ask questions. Each side is allowed a chance to respond.
# The two sides then give their closing statements, again within the limited time frame.

While this is a very interesting and civilized form of discussion, the limited time frame requires each side to choose which facts and arguments they wish to present. Furthermore, the structure does not allow one side to stop the other if it disputes a specific claim. There is no process to "dive deep" into single point so that its impact may be fully established.

This limitation exists in formal debate, but holds for informal discussion as well. In order to not distract from the "main point", we have to pick and choose which points are worth discussing at any given moment.

'''''Not enough memory'''''

Humans cannot possibly hold in their minds a complete picture of all the information related to a specific debate. Even experts on a subject would be expected to have to refer to documents, studies and other primary sources of information in order to hold a comprehensive discussion on a topic of debate. When a debate is held in real time, to compensate, points must often be made on the basis of “feelings”. At best, an aggregated opinion based on previous in-depth studies can be expressed, but it must be taken on faith by the other parties, or disregarded entirely. This is yet one more reason why the act of passing on important information from one person to the next can only be partially successful.

'''''It's usually about "winning"'''''

If discussion were always a cooperative activity in which parties joined forces (memory and intellect) to come to the best conclusion, then it is possible that humankind would be able to overcome the limitations cited above. Unfortunately, debates are often adversarial in nature, and too often focus on which side can “win” the debate, either by making the best show of things to an external audience, or by convincing their "opponents" that they are in the right (or at least overwhelming them with better arguments). Under such conditions, truth is only a secondary concern, and it can be tempting to employ logical fallacies in the name of making a point.

Unfortunately, as common as this posture is, truth may not be the only casualty here. The adversarial approach belies a lack of empathy for other participants, and can lead to alienation between those of differing opinions, driving a wedge between those that would otherwise benefit from cooperation.

'''''Preparation matters'''''

Under ideal circumstances, a debate would have the best representation possible from all perspectives. Unfortunately, in addition to the limitations cited above of time and human memory, there is the problem of unevenness of knowledge and experience between individuals. A debate may be won or lost based on which side has studied the subject in more depth, and is more prepared to relate and defend their arguments. No real-time debate can be said to present a complete picture, and witnesses and participants can therefore be swayed by whichever side is better prepared to represent their half.

'''''Eloquence matters'''''

One final variable in the result of a debate that is immaterial to the actual substance of the subject is the way in which the arguments are made. Unfortunately, the "winner" of a debate may be decided by who is the better speaker, rather than by which side has the strongest case. 

===1.3 The Problem with Politics.===

Politics, or governance in general, is one area in which the results of a debate can have an enormous impact on the lives of the people involved. Unfortunately, political debates as they stand today, with the most vocal participants being delegates or representatives who have their own careers and agendas at stake, suffer their own set of acute deficiencies.

'''''Risk aversion'''''

Politics is a strange form of popularity contest, in which careers are based and world-changing decisions made on the basis of getting the most votes (for a person, not an issue). This means that bold or risky opinions are discouraged, as are blue-sky brainstorms and general speculation. As a result, there is a bias in the process towards more tepid and conservative proposals, even though this often leads to sub-par outcomes.

'''''Uncertainty is not allowed'''''

Politicians are discouraged from showing uncertainty. This reduces the level of honesty in the discussion, and closes the door on external discourse.

'''''Changing opinions is a sign of weakness'''''

It is considered a lack of leadership, intelligence and/or backbone to change one’s opinion in public as a politician. This almost completely eliminates the purpose of constructive discourse, which is to arrive at a consensus cooperatively through the exchange of arguments and evidence.

'''''Ambiguity is rewarded'''''

In order to appeal to a larger group, and to avoid risking the accusation of being a “waffler”, statements from politicians tend to be as abstract, unspecific and non-committal as possible, while still trying to strike an emotional chord. This kind of discourse avoids the difficult questions rather than facing them head-on.

'''''The problems are too complex'''''

In fact, many of the policy issues that will be affected by the outcome of political debates and public votes are much too complex for any single individual to master. It would be absurd to expect an entire population to grasp these issues in the depth required. This is known as the problem of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance Rational Ignorance]: if it takes more effort than is worth it to understand something well enough (to vote on it), people won’t do it. Thus, political discussions tend to resort to metaphors and proxy issues (such as the issue of gay marriage) as a substitute for meatier topics.

'''''Horse trading'''''

There is a problem with the way legislation is designed and proposed. It is designed based on what the authors THINK will be passable, then goes through a round of horse-trading, in which items get slipped into the bill totally unrelated to the purpose of the legislation in order to “buy” the votes of specific representatives. In the end, decisions are made at least partially not on whether or not it is a good idea, but rather, that it is a “passable” idea.

'''''Gaming the system'''''

An important part of politics is also figuring out the best way to get legislation passed by avoiding proper due dilligence and the need to build consensus. Decisions may be rushed: either presented and rushed to vote before all the delegates have had a chance to read it, or rushed so that there can be a vote before the session ends, before vacation, or before dynamics change (elections).

Then there are also the “at least we tried” bills: legislation proposed insincerely as a form of showing constituents that an attempt was made, without really reaching across the table to find some sort of middle ground.

'''''Focus on the wrong things'''''

Politics very often focuses on the character of the candidate, rather than on the issues they support. While to some degree this is justified in that the character of a representative matters to the extent that voters much trust in them to make the right decisions over their term, it would be difficult to argue that voters have enough information to really predict how their representative will think and behave. Furthermore, discussions about their "character" often focus on less relevant issues, such as their romantic involvements, the way they shake hands, or the way they screamed on camera in an unfortunate moment.

Also, legislation is often dressed up in such a way to be easy to publicize and gain acceptance, while hiding the details of its impact. Legislation is intentionally named with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym bacronyms] that purport to represent its purpose, such as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act USA PATRIOT Act] and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpstart_Our_Business_Startups_Act JOBS Act], in the hopes that voters will read no further. Also, legislation will be given nicknames meant to deride its purpose in order to [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/upshot/one-third-dont-know-obamacare-and-affordable-care-act-are-the-same.html create voter bias].

'''''The real debate is hidden'''''

Much of what really happens in the process of policy decisions happens behind closed doors, off the public record. Whether it’s in conversations with lobbyists, political whips, large donors, personal family influence, conversations with a pastor, or something else, much of what goes into making up the mind of a representative happens out of sight, through personal contact. Once a decision has been made, a conscious effort is made to find a way to frame it to the public in such a way that it can be "justified". While this is actually a natural part of the process (imagine if you were a representative - wouldn’t you want feedback from family and friends?), as a side effect, it actually disempowers the remainder of a representative’s constituents.

'''''Lack of local information'''''

Especially for local elections and referendums, which should be more familiar with voters, there is ironically a severe lack of relevant information. This is unfortunate, as the more local an issue is, the more likely it is to impact voters. Unfortunately, there is no consistent resource for local voter information the way there is for national issues.

===1.4 The Human Condition.===

There are many problems with our attempts at collaboration that could be more effective were it not for certain characteristics of the people participating in these activities. These problems may be difficult to solve directly with technology, but can certainly be improved through proper education, and some guidance from the tools used in collaboration.

'''''People don't know how to argue'''''

A large percentage of the world population does not know what makes for a reasonable argument. While logic and rhetoric are taught in many schools, it seems that it is not very common to employ these skills in practice. Both online and offline, it appears that discussions are rife with logical fallacies, and it is more common to see arguments of an adversarial rather than a constructive nature.

'''''People assume the worst'''''

In online discussions, even among friends, it seems that very simple statements can be read with the worst possible interpretation. This is in part due to tribalism, but it seems to have become a social norm to assume bad intentions (or stupidity), rather than an honest difference of opinion, as the source of disagreement. The problem is exacerbated when brief written statements are the medium, since there is no room for nuance, caveats, or detailed context. In order to make a point, it may be necessary to resort to extreme examples, without room to explain that the author understands they are exaggerating. Responses are often equally extreme. This phenomenon has even given rise to the infamous [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law Godwin's Law], which is basically an attempt to make people recognize when the discussion has veered too far from good sense.

This problem could be solved if everyone were to adopt the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity Principle of Charity]. Unfortunately, it would be hoping too much to expect this to happen any time soon.

'''''People are lazy'''''

Humans are generally too lazy to do the research necessary to verify if any supposed fact they read online is actually true. Although there are several reliable fact-checking services available, very few people go to the effort of consulting them. Meanwhile, there is a natural human bias towards believing information that supports a pre-existing opinion, and doubting one that debunks it. This leads to certain lies spreading very quickly online.

'''''Cognitive Biases'''''

Lastly, there is a long (and growing) and well-documented list of errors or irrationality in human thinking, collectively known as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases cognitive biases]. These are perhaps the most subtle and most difficult issues to rectify in the course of deliberation. However, as they are studied, and people learn more about them, our chances of succeeding improve.

===1.5 Current State of the Art.===

There have been in the past, and are at present, many attempts to resolve the problems with debate listed above to one degree or another. Since concern has grown following the 2016 election cycle for the United States regarding the problem of "fake news", many solutions have been created to focus on countering the trend and to restore trust in journalism. Fact-checking sites have become an integral part of the online discussion, existing platforms such as Facebook and Google are rethinking their model for recommending content. Also, projects and businesses have been created with the aim of providing additional context to discussions via various means. In the area of argument mapping, there have been many efforts to create a rich and complete picture of important debates, some by way of careful curation by an internal team, while others permit external users to supply the arguments.

None of the approaches we have seen so far have been able to provide a complete solution for the problems we have listed above. In this section we outline many of the characteristics we believe are required, but are generally missing from the solutions we have seen.

'''''Centralization of control'''''

If the debate is "owned" by a single entity (in terms of who can edit the data), without complete and trustworthy transparency and history, the solution is subject to accusations of favoritism. As noble as the mission may be, it is always possible to cast aspersions on the organization that holds the keys to its operation. We have seen this in the case of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks WikiLeaks], which has been accused of international partisanship. We are also beginning to see this occur with [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/12/22/the-daily-mail-snopes-story-and-fact-checking-the-fact-checkers/#49d400b1227f fact-checking sites].

If any entity has the power to edit the history of a debate, prevent access to certain parties, or change votes, it doesn't matter how honest the organization actually is. It will be possible for anyone that disagrees with the results to cast doubts upon the reliability of the platform, and provide an excuse for their followers to ignore the information. It also provides fertile ground for such parties to create their own competing platforms, and thus end this attempt at canonicality.

'''''Centralization of data'''''

Even if the platform is completely transparent and verifiable, if the content of the debate is owned by a single party, there is a risk that the debate will one day disappear if that entity ceases to exist. This undermines the perceived value in participation in a number of ways: The more permanent a contribution seems, the more incentive one has to go through the effort. Also, no matter how trusted the custodian of the information may be during its time of operation, there is a risk that a change of management, or a case of desperate insolvency may lead to a corruption of the original intents.

'''''Conflicts of interest'''''

The problem that faces the majority of communication platforms online at present is the inherent conflict of interest between the platform host, which generally has a commercial for-profit purpose, and its users. This is the crisis currently facing Facebook and other platforms at the moment, which generate revenue by selling user data for advertising and other purposes. These platforms are already extremely powerful due to the [https://www.ft.com/content/3dfa397c-9a73-11e4-8426-00144feabdc0 number of "signals"] users are providing them, based on simple upvotes. A platform that deals in complex debate topics has an incredible opportunity to understand the thinking, beliefs and opinions of its users on just about any subject that motivates them enough to participate. There is an incredible danger for this platform to be abused by its host unless all care is taken to ensure the good of the platform is completely aligned with the good of its users.

'''''Fake accounts'''''

Most implementations do not provide adequate protection against [https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper#263_Sybil_Attack "Sybil" accounts] (fake accounts). Any solution that includes voting (upvotes, scoring, etc.) is subject to "attacks" by networks by fake accounts attempting to sway the outcome of the debate. This has been a major enabler of propaganda campaigns, for such mundane purposes as [https://devumi.com/twitter-followers/ increasing the reputation] of public figures and thought leaders to actual [https://www.recode.net/2018/2/16/17021048/robert-mueller-russia-facebook-social-media-donald-trump-presidential-campaign-2016-hillary-clinton attempts by foreign governments] to sway elections.

In order to make it easy for new users to sign up, most platforms opt for very low requirements in terms of verification of new users. None to date, outside of official government agencies, and certain financial institutions with "Know Your Customer" (KYC) requirements go through any effort to certify that there is a one-to-one correspondence between user accounts and actual human beings. 

When governance is a concern, and a one-vote-per-person strategy is the standard, this guarantee is necessary. Likewise, in the case of the canonical debate, where trust is an essential component, and where the goal is to attempt to honestly portray our collective knowledge and opinions, it is critical to fight for allowing only one vote per human.

'''''Not reusable'''''

Traditional argument mapping focuses on the debate around the validity of a single statement. This is decided by way of a tree structure of supporting and attacking arguments, each of which themselves may be attacked or defended. The result, in a complete mapping, is a judgement that can be made regarding that single statement. No consideration is given regarding how that result could be used in future debates, nor in how the effectiveness of one of the underlying arguments could be reused in a new context (debate).

Most solutions seen so far follow this pattern. They do not treat the debates as canonical. That is, they treat each debate as a major topic to be discussed on its own, a separate, isolated entity, whose result cannot be used in future debates. This prevents knowledge from accumulating to the degree we believe possible, and necessary if we are to find any hope of a trajectory towards a better future.

'''''Not popular'''''

There is a certain circularity behind the reasoning in this problem, and in fact it is difficult, if not impossible, to design a solution that can resolve this issue with any guarantee. Unfortunately, by definition, the canonical debate must be so well-known as to be the main, if not the only place to consult and participate in this type of debate. 

No solution so far has managed to become THE place for debate. Until one succeeds in this respect, our knowledge will remain fragmented, with continued loss in efficiency, and no guarantee of providing a complete vision on complex and confusing topics. Our proposal for a canonical debate can offer strategies for accomplishing this goal, but there is no way of ensuring we will succeed.

'''''Insufficient curation'''''

In order for a canonical debate to remain canonical, in the sense of singular and unique, it is necessary to ensure that there is no duplication of information or arguments. There are a number of other challenges as well related to keeping the debates organized, readable and sensible that, at least for now, require expert human attention to maintain. Unfortuantely, most current implementations lack the tools necessary to keep the debate organized, clean and productive.

'''''Bad user experience'''''

Debate is a VERY complex activity. It needs to be trivially easy to read and to use. Unfortunately, argument maps in general tend to be extremely boring for the average user to read and navigate, which defeats the purpose of educating the public. Furthermore, it can be rather cumbersome to understand the structure of a debate and provide a valuable contribution [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dJJYgmaYYFmHoQM4L/debate-tools-an-experience-report without exerting more effort] than what more than the most dedicated (or fanatical) users may be willing to provide.

In preliminary experiments with various projects created by our founding members, we have seen first-hand the difficulty in capturing the complexity of debates while at the same time creating an environment that doesn't discourage use. We applaud the site [https://www.kialo.com/ Kialo] for making great strides in terms of usability and innovation in terms of the visualization of argument maps. However, the site lacks many of the other characteristics listed here, and we believe that there is both more improvements that should be made, and more complexity that must be incorporated into a canonical solution.

'''''Boring'''''

Overlapping with, but distinct from the problem of the user experience, it is apparent that deconstructed debates, removed from individuals, and avoiding incendiary speech can unfortunately be very dry. This makes the platform difficult to achieve mass adoption, and therefore canonicality. A successful solution must find a way to engage human emotion in the process, while at the same time maintaining its integrity.

'''''No context'''''

None of the solutions we have seen to date have taken "context" to be a critical element of any claims or arguments. Context is not used at all as an element of the debate, and can only colloquially be said to be "relating to the debate at hand". Unfortunately, the result tends to be that claims and arguments are made at a somewhat generic level, or are given as examples that are so concrete that they can only be considered anectdotal evidence at best.

This lack of context impedes the reusability of claim. It can result in them being used incorrectly, as statements may be given multiple interpretations, or used in a more generic or specific situation than they were originally intended. It can also cause confusion in the debate itself if the participants use different interpretations of the claim being made.

'''''No concept of generic vs. specific'''''

It is very common to begin a debate with a very broad statement, such as "Illicite drugs should be legalized." When such a broad topic is debated in earnest, you will find that the discussion can range from one spectrum of the debate (e.g. all drugs vs. a specific illegal substance, such as heroine) to another (in which geographical locations, and under which conditions).

It should become evident after some contact with generic debates that they are generally unresolvable. The best you can do is come up with conditions under which the claim would be true, and others in which it would be false. Unfortunately, solutions that we have analyzed so far do not provide any inherent support for navigating such a "debate space", and carrying arguments or heuristics from one level of granularity to another.

'''''Inadequate scoring'''''

Scoring of claims and arguments is an important feature of this type of platform, as we will describe in more detail in later sections. Amongst other purposes, the scores serve as a mechanism for sorting arguments in order of those that are the most relevant to arguments that will have little or no impact. 

'''''No tools for contemplation'''''

Debates are generally treated as a fixed entity, with only the overall popular consensus considered. There is no way to inspect the debate specifically from the perspective of the user, or from the perspective of someone else.

'''''Overly simplified model'''''

This is a catch-all for features otherwise not called out in this section. The solution just doesn’t offer all the features we consider necessary. (That is, they don’t solve all the concerns listed in the Problems section).

==3. Solution.==

Work in Progress - these are just notes taken from the Slack channel

The solution is to build the missing piece to the internet. The problem is a structural one. But it is possible to build a fix, one that can change the way people interact. There are several examples of this. Think how the world was before and after each of these pieces were added:
* Google
* Wikipedia
* Text messaging
* Twitter
* Facebook

None of these pieces have fulfilled the “promise of the internet”, but they have radically changed the way we interact, for better or worse. What, then, is needed to fulfill that promise?


===3.1 Basic Elements.===

There is a general academic consensus regarding the structure of a debate, at least as it relates to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory argumentation] in the form of a dialectic. However, to a large degree this research focuses on debates within the context of actors performing the debate, providing their arguments and counter-arguments in response. While this foundational work profoundly informs the design of our solution, it is not generally adapted for the context we are proposing: that of a canonical debate, independent of specific actors.

What follows is a description of the principle elements of such a debate, and how they relate to one another.

===3.1.1 Claim.===

A Claim in Gruff is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition proposition], a statement which is intended to be taken as fact, or as the truth. In many cases (in fact, in the majority of cases), agreement on the validity of the statement is not universal. These differences of opinion form the foundation for debate, and the purpose of Gruff is to provide the tools for participants to work together to come to the best possible vision regarding the validity of a Claim.

=====3.1.1.1 Examples of and Variations on Claims.=====

Although deceptively simple in concept, in practice there is a lot to consider (and for Gruff to support). Gruff can work with several types of Claim:

* A proposed fact: ''The Earth is not flat.''
* A statement of subjective opinion: '''This reporter is a moron.'''
* A proposed course of action: ''We should dedicate all our resources towards preventing meteor impacts.''

In each of these examples, there is a slightly different set of possible outcomes to the debate:

* Fact: ''true'' or ''false''
* Opinion: ''agree'' or ''disagree''
* Proposal: ''yes'' or ''no''

What they all have in common is that their outcome is binary. In other words, a Claim is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic Dialectic].

=====3.1.1.2 Canonicality.=====

One of the problems stated in the first section of this white paper is that the quality of our debates is weakened by the fractured nature of current discussions. A common fact may be discussed ad nauseum online, and yet reach no conclusion as each new participant must start from a position of ignorance. A mixture of impatience and limited memory leads to each new participant receiving an abbreviated or erroneous version of the debate, upon which they must build their opinions and pass on to the next person.

In the Gruff platform, Claims are created, and their debate can result in a large number of arguments and counter arguments. Even a simple example, such as the previous "The Earth is not flat" Claim can generate [https://www.popsci.com/10-ways-you-can-prove-earth-is-round#page-2 a large quantity of proofs] and counter-proofs. But that's not the end of life for a Claim: the validity of one Claim can affect the debate over another. For example, the statement "We should sail west to reach the Indies" could hang quite critically on whether or not the Earth is a sphere. Likewise, a statement about how long the sun stays up in the summer on the North Pole would depend on this.

All too common what happens in a one-on-one debate is that we use claims that we take for granted to prove the proposition at hand, only to discover that the other party doesn't agree with our statement. It's one thing if it's a difference of opinion, but it is a problem if the other party doesn't have the same information as you regarding your claim, or has information that you don't have. In such cases, we can either ignore this problem (in which case the counterpart will probably just ignore your claim), or divert attention from the main debate at hand to go into detail rehashing a debate over this new claim.

Debate platforms must also deal with this problem: What happens when a Claim that has already been fully debated is used in a totally separate debate? Many systems ignore this issue, and leave it up to the users to restate their Claims in each new debate, resulting in a repetition of the previous debate, often skipping some arguments, and perhaps adding new ones that were missed the first time around.

We can solve this problem by making Claims ''canonical''. For each Claim, there can and must be only one place to debate its validity. When a Claim is used in a debate with another Claim, it would be a waste to make a new copy. Instead, that debate refers to the Claim (and all its discussions) in its [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_form canonical] place so that none of the original debate is lost. Furthermore, should new arguments or information ever arise relating to the Claim, it can be added to the canonical debate, and its impact will ripple across all other debates that have relied on this Claim in some form.

=====3.1.1.3 Attributes.=====

* Unique ID

* Arguments based on this Claim

=====3.1.1.4 Confidence/Belief.=====

TODO: talk about the sliding scale of confidence in a Claim. Even though a Claim is a binary proposition, it doesn't mean we have to believe it completely. And since debates are done as a group, the veracity score is really a measure of the overall group's belief in the statement.

=====3.1.1.5 Complex Claims.=====

Multiple premises, etc.

=====3.1.1.6 Changing Perspectives.=====

Positive vs. Negative vs. Question

====3.1.2 Argument.====

When a Claim is used in a debate to prove or disprove another Claim, we call this an Argument. Arguments are generally made either in favor of a Claim or against it (although sometimes it can go either way - see below). There are a few different, but synonymous ways to describe which side of the debate an Argument supports:

* Argument In Favor/Argument Against
* Argument For/Argument Against
* Pro Argument/Con Argument
* Supporting Argument/Attacking Argument (or Opposing Argument)

Although an Argument may be confused with the Claim it represents, it is not the same thing. It may have an identical title as the Claim on which it's based, but generally it will have a title that's more suiting or conversational for the debate (e.g. Claim: ''John Doe hates Jane Blow''; Argument: ''I hate your mother'').

=====3.1.2.1 Relevance.=====

While the veracity of the Claim is important on its own, what is important for an Argument is its relevance. That is, it's important to judge not only whether or not the Claim is true, but whether or not using it in the debate is meaningful. 

The most common example of an Argument that is by nature irrelevant is the well-known [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem ad hominem fallacy], in which the arguer attacks the nature of their opponent rather than the substance of their arguments. For example, the statement You have something green stuck between your teeth may be absolutely true, but that would have no consequence in a debate against the Claim The Earth is spherical.

A subtle distinction could be made between the ''relevance'' of an Argument (is it related to the topic at hand?) and its ''importance'' (how much should we care?). After some reflection, it was decided that the distinction between these two characteristics is unimportant for the purpose of this platform, and so the two are grouped together into the single attribute called Relevance.

=====3.1.2.2 Argument for an Argument.=====

As we like to say, "everything's debatable". That includes the Relevance of an Argument. One person may find it totally acceptable that the mattress is missing a spring in the corner; another may consider that the most important part of the bed. In this case, it becomes important for each side to make Arguments for or against the Argument, rather than the Claim (or Argument!) the Argument is attacking or supporting.

* Argument: ''The mattress is missing a spring in the corner''
** For: ''I need to sit on that corner to put on my shoes''
*** Against: ''We can turn the mattress around so that the corner you sit on has a spring''
**** Against: ''But then it will be where my head always ends up''
** Against: ''We can put in a new spring''

A number of Arguments and counter-Arguments have been provided in this example. The main Argument has two sub-Arguments, one arguing in favor and one against its Relevance. The argument in favor then has one Argument against its Relevance, and that sub-Argument has an Argument against.

What is only implicit in the example is that each of these Arguments and sub-Arguments are themselves based on a Claim (as with ALL Arguments). A more explicit version of the Arguments, with their Claims, would be as follows:

* Argument: ''The mattress is missing a spring in the corner''
* Claim: ''The mattress is missing a spring in the corner''
** Argument For Argument: ''I need to sit on that corner to put on my shoes''
** Claim: ''John Doe needs to sit on the corner of the mattress that is missing a spring in order to put on his shoes''
*** Argument Against Argument: ''We can turn the mattress around so that the corner you sit on has a spring''
*** Claim: ''The mattress can be turned so that the missing spring is not in the corner where John Doe needs to put on his shoes''
**** Argument Against Argument: ''But then it will be where my head always ends up''
**** Claim: ''If the mattress is rotated so that the missing spring is away from the place where John Doe puts on his shoes, it will place the missing spring where his head ends up at night''
** Argument Against Argument: ''We can put in a new spring''
** Claim: ''A new spring can be placed in the mattress at the corner where one is missing''

=====3.1.2.3 Relevance vs. Truth: Strength.=====

While an Argument is concerned with its Relevance, its Claim is concerned with its Truth. 

=====3.1.2.4 Arguments That Are Pro AND Con.=====

TODO: What about Arguments that can be considered for OR against something. Ex: "If we don't get a new mattress, my mother can't come stay with us?" Depending on one's feelings about the person's mother, that could be a very strong argument for OR against the proposition. How should Gruff handle this?

* Put scoring on a scale of -100 to 100, rather than 0 to 100 (for example)
* Allow debaters to add the same Claim to the debate twice, once via an Argument FOR the Claim, and once via an Argument AGAINST. It would then be up to each debater to make sure they have balanced their votes on each side… (20 for one side and 80 for the other, for example)

It's interesting to consider the impact on sub-arguments in each of these cases (and roll-up!). Take, for example, the Argument above:

''Should we get a new mattress?''
* For/Against: ''If we don't, my mother can't stay with us''
** For: ''I love my mother'' (Score: 100 for)
** Against: ''You hate my mother'' (Score: 100 against/-100 for)

Vs.

''Should we get a new mattress?''
* For: ''If we don't, my mother can't stay with us''
** For: ''I love my mother'' (Score: 100)
** Against: ''You hate my mother'' (Score: 100)
* Against: ''If we don't, my mother can't stay with us''
** For: ''You hate my mother'' (Score: 100)
** Against: ''I love my mother'' (Score: 100)

In both cases, the Argument is a wash. But in the first case, the representation of the Argument is confused (on which side of the debate do you show it?) and the scoring even more so. In the second case, the representation is redundant, and the Arguments will have to be duplicated on both sides (which seems contrary to the canonical philosophy).

=====3.1.2.5 Attributes.=====

Arguments have many of the same attributes as Claims, at least in terms of displaying them to debaters. In fact, the average person may not understand the concept of separating an Argument from its Claim; when one writes out the main points in a debate, they generally provide ONLY the Argument (with its Context-relative title), and the Claim itself remains implicit.

Nevertheless, Arguments do have a few differences:

* Unique ID
* Title
* Description
* Relevance Score
* The Claim upon which the Argument is based
* Arguments For/Against the Argument
* The Claim or Argument which this Argument supports or attacks (the Target)

In terms of the user interface, the Argument could also be displayed with some of the properties of its base Claim, such as:

* Relevant links
* Media
* Context

=====3.1.2.6 The Debate Graph.=====

TODO: Claims are the nodes; Arguments are the edges

=====3.1.2.7 Common Argument Types.=====

Although the platform will probably not provide explicit support for the Argument types below, it is interesting to note them here and discuss how they will be represented in the system.

======3.1.2.7.1 Evidence.======

Supporting evidence is essentially an objective fact presented as some sort of "proof" for a Claim. Common types of evidence include:

* A photo, video or other documentation of a supposed event
* Formal documentation of a fact (e.g. a birth certificate)
* Scientific studies
* Eye-witness reports

Unlike other forms of argumentation, evidence has a very strong history of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law) formal use in the practice of law]. This includes the importance of proving the provenance and authenticity of the evidence, as well as its reliability.

As a side note, the authenticity of digital media can be hard to prove. As technology improves the capacity to falsify speech and even video, this can be a critical threat to honest debate. Fortunately, cryptography and publicly shared ledgers (blockchain) may provide a countermeasure to this problem: if authentic recordings can be registered automatically on a blockchain the moment they are recorded, it will be in practical measures impossible to alter the recordings after the fact. Technology is always part of a cat-and-mouse game, so it is important to remain vigilant regarding the presentation of evidence.

======3.1.2.7.2 Logical and Informal Fallacies.======

The first thing one learns when studying rhetoric is the notion of a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy logical fallacy]. Some fallacies are formal, and so, if an Argument is shown to be an example of one, it can be shown to be completely ineffective (i.e. a Relevance Score of 0). Others are informal, and may in fact maintain some validity even in the face of an accusation of being a fallacy.

Take, for example, an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority Appeal to Authority]:

''Warren Buffet, the most successful investor of all time, says that it would be unwise to invest in cryptocurrencies.''

An Argument that could be used against the Strength of this Argument would be:

''This is an Appeal to Authority, and doesn't help explain why one shouldn't invest.''

In Gruff, every Argument must have an underlying Claim, and in this case that Claim would be:

''Using an Appeal to Authority as an Argument does not help support a debate logically''

Once this Claim has been presented (and debated - and this topic is, in fact, contentious) in the system, it is ready to be reused for any other debate as needed. And so it should be for the entire list of both formal and informal fallacies.

Note that deep consideration has been given to making fallacies a special category or feature within Gruff all its own. However, it became clear that not only is the basic structure of Claims and Arguments sufficient; it also permits active debate on use of the fallacies.

======3.1.2.7.3 Basic Values and Principles.======

TODO

====3.1.3 Request for Information (RFI)====

A placeholder argument requesting that someone with expertise in the field provide some concrete information (e.g. "What is the difference in relative salary between men and women for college graduates for the period from 2010 through 2017?"). 

It is common for people in a debate to realize that information outside the scope of their knowledge could dramatically sway their opinion on a matter, assuming it could be trusted. In a live debate, those points can only be avoided, but in the canonical debate, there is the opportunity to request for experts to fill in the blanks. Much like Quora, it should be possible for users to follow specific topics (Contexts) in order to receive notifications for RFIs in their area of expertise.

====3.1.4 Debate.====

Although the whole purpose of the project is to facilitate debates, a debate is not really a first-class citizen in Gruff. Debate is more of a verb than a noun. In fact, there is no object or element in the design of Gruff specifically called a "Debate". Rather, we say that everything on the platform (Claims, Arguments, Evidence) is ''debatable''. Debating is the process of working as a group to come to a consensus, if not on the truth of a Claim, at least on what are the principle points of difference, the beliefs and the set of values that each one must know and balance.

===3.2 Supporting Elements.===

====3.2.1 Context.====

Many logical fallacies are made during the course of debates just on the basis of using evidence, statistics or supposed facts from one context and applying them within the very different context of the debate. Another common problem is cherry-picking a study from one very specific place, and obscuring or removing its context in an attempt to make a much more general statement. It is also very common to witness a disconnect between the two sides of a debate as one side focuses on one context and the other focuses on another.

The canonical debate platform resolves this problem through the explicit declaration of Context elements for each Claim. These elements to some degree can be thought of as the dictionary definition of each of the words used in the Claim itself. For example, in the argument: ''John Doe hates my mother'', the Context could be declared as follows:

'''John Doe''' (''Context: Jonathan Randall Joe, SSN: 112-12-0234, USA'') 
hates 
'''my mother''' (''Janathan Rosalyn Blow, SSN: 052-33-0101, USA'')

This Claim has been declared with two Contexts which, presumably, avoid confusion about which individuals we are discussing. However, this still leaves some wiggle room for an Argument of the type:

No
'''I''' (''Context: Jonathan Randall Joe, SSN: 112-12-0234, USA'')
do not. I merely despise
'''her''' (''Janathan Rosalyn Blow, SSN: 052-33-0101, USA'').

Thus, it would be desirable to provide Context definitions even for verbs, although that may prove difficult to achieve.

=====3.2.1.1 Knowledge Graphs.=====

It would be a phenomenal task to attempt to build a database of all the possible Contexts that could be required for public debates. Fortunately, there are some incredible organizations that have already shouldered this burden. These include:

* [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page Wikidata]
* [https://www.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia]
* [https://www.google.com/intl/bn/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html Google Knowledge Graph]
* [http://wiki.dbpedia.org/ DBPedia]

Any of these online databases can be used as the source for a Context element, which includes an external link to the specific definition.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr. Donald Trump] does not wear a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toup%C3%A9e toupée].

However, if none of these sources provides the required reference, it should be possible to define one, either within the system itself, or via some other external source.

=====3.2.1.2 Context to Refine Debates.=====

One very common problem in debates is the tendency to generalize the statistics in one context to a much larger context, without any clear indication that it is reasonable to do so. This is known as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasty_generalization Hasty Generalization fallacy], and is only one example of fallacies due to loose or uncareful use of Context. One of the benefits of making Context explicit is the ability to identify when this is the case, and correct for it.

Consider the following Claim:

''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration Immigrants] are responsible for higher rates of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime crime].''

This is an extremely general statement. There should therefore be a much greater burden to prove such a statement than, for example, what the original author of the Claim intended to say:

''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States Undocumented immigrants in the United States] in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade decades] between [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_(decade) 2000] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s 2018] have been the principle cause of an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_statistics#Measures increase] in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime violent crime] in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Breakdown_by_state cities where they are most present].''

This would be a relatively easier Claim to prove, and perhaps a better place to start for a much more complex debate. However, it's easy to envision breakdowns of this one Claim by city, and perhaps even by neighborhood, year, or population, should it interest the debating public.

=====3.2.1.3 Context and Arguments.=====

This section began by discussing the relationship between Context and Claims, and yet the first examples were really relating Contexts to Arguments. This was a bit misleading, as Arguments do not themselves possess any Context. Arguments merely provide a link between two separate Claims, each of which has its own set of Contexts. Therefore, the Context of an Argument is actually the Context of its underlying Claim (which is being used within the Context of the target Claim or Argument).

=====3.2.1.4 Context and Relevance.=====

Consider then the following Claim:

''Study X conducted by the University of Lalaland shows that violent crime rates in communities in the U.S. with a high population of Nambian refugees shows an unusually high number of violent crimes between 2014 and 2017.''

Should this Claim be used as an Argument in the prior debate regarding crime rates, a few things should become evident regarding its Context:

# It refers to refugees, rather than undocumented immigrants
# The study covers only a portion of the time period being debated in the Claim

This implies that the Relevance score of the Argument itself should NOT be the maximum possible score. It cannot conclusively prove the Claim because its Context is not a perfect match. In fact the first point implies that this Argument may not be relevant at all.
Likewise, if the study were regarding undocumented immigrants in Germany rather than the United States, or during a previous century, its relevance would also be in question. What this reveals is that Context is directly linked to the Relevance of Arguments that are used for or against a Claim.

In the current iteration of Gruff, no attempt is being made to automate calculations of relevance based on Context; however, Context may be used to flag to users when there is no match whatsoever, or to recommend Claims that seem to have Contexts that match the target Claim.

===3.3 Scoring.===

It's very important to collect all the Arguments and information available related to a debate, and make them available to everyone interested. However, some Arguments are better than others, and keeping with the principle of reducing friction, there should be a way of separating the chaff from the wheat. In fact, many of our Principles can be supported through a process of numerically evaluating and weighing the different Arguments. To this end, Gruff supports several different formulas for rating, or "Scoring" Claims and Arguments.

====3.3.1 Purpose.====

Scoring serves the following purposes:

* Sort Arguments in terms of their effectiveness
* Reveal popular opinions on debates
* Allow users to view debates through the lens of their own beliefs
* Allow users to view the same debates through the lens of other users (anonymously)
* Reveal how the validity (or lack thereof) of underlying Claims can strengthen or weaken Arguments
* Reveal inconsistencies in the beliefs of a user
* Reveal hidden biases

''Important!''
Scoring should not be about who "wins". The goal is not to put your side on top! (although that seems like the obvious point). The point is to get a clearer view of your own personal viewpoint on the debate. When this is what is given the focus, the value of the debate becomes clearer. 

====3.3.2 Criteria.====

Before designing a scoring method, it's important to reflect on what are characteristics we want in a scoring algorithm. Certainly, the method should help us achieve each of the goals listed in the section above. No one algorithm (at least so far) is perfectly suited to every objective, and so Gruff supports several different approaches, as described below. Multiple equations were tried and discarded, and others were maintained.

The following guidelines were used in the selection process. None of the methods satisfies all of them in every case.

'''''The result of just one Argument shouldn’t be better than the Strength of that argument'''''

It would be misleading, for example, to award a score of 100% to a Claim that is supported by only one Argument with a Strength Score of 30% (because it's either possibly untrue, or largely irrelevant).

'''''Adding another Argument on a side should increase the weight on that side'''''

If a Claim is supported by an Argument with nearly 100% Strength, and a second, weaker Argument is provided to prop up the first, it wouldn't make sense to take an average (for example), which would reduce the overall support of the Claim. 

As a corollary to this, increasing the score of one of the Arguments should always increase the weight on that side, or at least not be harmful to its case.

'''''A single Argument with a Strength of 100% and no opposition should have a result of 100%''''

And, correspondingly, a 100% effective counter-argument should result in a score of 0%, assuming there are no supporting Arguments. A good example of this is a piece of irrefutable evidence: just one good piece of evidence should be enough to prove a Claim.

'''''Adding an Argument with a Score of 0% should not affect the result'''''

An Argument with a Score of 0% is either completely false, totally irrelevant, or both. It would definitely be a problem if participants could alter the outcome of a debate by spamming the discussion with ineffective Arguments.

'''''Re-grouping shouldn’t change the outcome significantly'''''

This is the hardest criteria to support mathematically. Intuitively, assuming that all Arguments have been sufficiently vetted, rebutted and voted, performing a Group Arguments curation to place several weaker Arguments beneath a more general heading should not weaken or exaggerate the outcome for that side. Three partially-relevant Arguments (30% each, let's say), should be just as effective separately as one more relevant (e.g. 65%) Argument that has them as supporting Arguments.

'''''The outcome should match human intuition'''''

This is the necessary catch-all for any criteria we may have missed. If the outcome of a calculation doesn't match what people would expect (and this is hard to define, since each person has a slightly different intuition), then we must pause and consider what we were expecting and why. Then, adjust the algorithm accordingly.

Some of the more difficult questions to consider here are:

* If both sides have 100% convincing (Strong) Arguments, but one side has extra supporting Arguments, should we declare that side to be more convincing? (What does 100% mean in this case?)
* Is one 80% Strength Argument more effective, the same, or less than two 40% Strength Arguments?
* If not, how many 40% Arguments would it take to defeat an 80% Argument

====3.3.3 Scoring Methods.====

=====3.3.3.1 Claim vs. Argument.=====

The Score of a Claim is a representation of its truthfulness, the confidence that people can have that the statement represents a true statement. Since this is synonymous with a debate, arriving at a Truth Score for the Claim can be considered the objective of that debate. However, as will be shown below, the Truth Score of a Claim is an important factor in the scores of Arguments upon which they are based. In other words, the Truth Score reflects on any debate in which a Claim is used.

Debates over an Argument affect its Relevance Score. These debates take the form of other Arguments in support of or attacking the relevance or significance of the Argument in the context of this debate (arguments against the accuracy of the argument are actually Arguments applied to the base Claim, rather than the Argument itself).

Depending on the Scoring Method, as described below, the way a Relevance Score is calculated may or may not be mathematically equivalent to the way a Truth Score is derived.

======3.3.3.1.1 Truth Score.======

======3.3.3.1.2 Strength Score.======

Now, consider the following situation: Argument A has a Relevance Score of 70%, and Argument B has a Relevance Score of -70%; however, the Claim underlying Argument A (let's call this Claim AC) has a Truth Score of only 50%, while the Claim underlying Argument B (Claim BC) has a Truth Score of 100% (everyone magically seems to agree with it). How should that impact Claim A? Should an Argument that stands on shakier grounds be considered just as strong as one that doesn't?

For this, we can borrow a basic principle from software engineering: if you have one system that is down 90% of the time, and it depends on another that is also offline 90% of the time, how reliable is it? The answer to this problem is to [http://www.weibull.com/hotwire/issue181/article181.htm multiply the two reliabilities] to get the reliability of the system as a whole: 

0.9 x 0.9 = 0.81, or 81%

This makes a lot of intuitive sense for a Strength Score, as well. If an Argument has a Relevance of 100% (absolutely definitive, if true) and its Claim has a Truth of 100% (absolutely true), then the Strength should be 100% (you can't possibly do better than that). If both are 0% (totally irrelevant, and false), then Strength would have to be 0%. But also, something that is 100% convincing, but based on a total lie should be 0% effective, as with an absolute truth that is completely off the subject. And, what about something that is absolutely convincing if true, but we're only 50% sure it's true? A Strength of 50% seems perfectly reasonable.

Therefore, the Strength Score S of an Argument A, with a Relevance Score of RA, which is based on a Claim C, with a Truth Score of TC, is:

S = RA * TC

======3.3.3.1.3 Roll-up Scores.======

TODO: explain the idea behind roll-up scores


=======3.3.3.1.3.1 Roll-up Levels.=======

TODO: explain that for many algorithms, you choose how deep you want to go

=======3.3.3.1.3.2 Arguments and Claims without Arguments.=======

What should we do for the Roll-up Score if we encounter an Argument or a Claim that doesn't have any Arguments of its own? In this case, it will not be possible to calculate any deeper than this. Instead, the calculation will have to substitute this for its Popular Score; that is, its Strength Score or Truth Score, without any other weighting.

In the case of a Claim with no Popular Score (no votes), the default Score of 50% is used. For an Argument with no Popular Score, the default Score of 0% is used.


=====3.3.3.2 Types of Scores.=====

======3.3.3.2.1 Objective Scoring.======

Reason Score is a vote-free scoring algorithm that places an emphasis on the interaction of Claims and counter-Claims, rather than popular opinion. Reason Score is meant to provide an objective account of the debate, rather than a personal or subjective one. With the voting-based scoring methods, you can defend your side of the debate by scoring the Claims according to your Belief. With Reason Score, the only way to impact the final result is by providing a new, reasonable Claim. Instead of casting a vote you provide a claim to explain why you would have voted differently than the current score.  Reason Score therefore encourages Debaters to think through their objections to a given topic and put it in words, which can result in more complete sets of Claims. 

As a side benefit, Reason Score values do not have to be set to zero after Curation actions (see below), unlike with voting scores. On the other hand, Curation can have a significant impact on the results. Assuming Curation is handled correctly, this is not necessarily a negative trait.


======3.3.3.2.2 Personal Scores.======

======3.3.3.2.3 Popular Vote.======

The Popular Vote is a very straightforward mechanism for scoring. On any Claim or Argument, Debaters can register their opinion on the Score of an element. The Popular Vote, then, is simply the average of all votes.

Popular voting can be considered a "dangerous" form of viewing the results of a debate. There are several reasons for this:

'''''It can be subject to attack by dishonest voters, especially those with many fake accounts'''''

This is a very genuine concern. It is critical that debates not be influenced or dominated by bad actors with fake accounts. As stated in the Principles, the system must guarantee to the best of our ability that there is only one account per person. 

'''''Just showing the Popular Vote can distort the outcome, due to popularity bias'''''

There will certainly be some distortion due to this effect - there is no escaping the way our brain works, not completely. However, the main purpose here is not to see which side wins, but rather to provide the tools to help people understand themselves, which is the first tool in the fight against cognitive bias. 

'''''There is no guarantee the popular outcome is the right outcome'''''

This is true, but the Popular Score here is not meant to be used as THE measure used for a vote. Rather, it is meant to help each potential voter figure out where they stand on the issue when the time comes to vote. The "tyranny of the majority" is a problem for a democracy, and therefore outside the scope of this system. For more information on how this can be resolved, see the [https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper Democracy Earth white paper]. With the creation of this system, we certainly hope that the majority will be much more understanding and accommodating, rather than tyrannical.

=====3.3.3.3 Score Perspectives.=====

======3.3.3.3.1 Belief Perspective.======

Scoring up to this point has been based on using the average of the Popular Score for each element. This is fine when what one wants is a census on popular opinion. However, this is not enough to support two of the main objectives of this platform:

'''''Provide tools for people to understand themselves'''''
'''''Provide ways for people to see the world from another’s perspective'''''

An individual's vote on the score of a Claim or an Argument is, in essence, a statement of their Belief on that subject. For example, it may fine to see that 56% of participants believe that a particular person was telling the truth when they made a statement, but if you believe they were lying, you would want to see that reflected in the Truth Score as a 0%, not as 56%.

As we saw with the Roll-up Score calculations above, the score on one item can have a significant impact on the results of another debate that relies on the Claim. When it comes to seeing popular opinion, one should use the Popular Score, but when it comes to making up one's own mind, it would be useful to ignore the opinions of everyone else, and instead use their own scores.

We call this view the Belief Score. It uses the same mathematics as the Popular Vote and Roll-up Score mechanisms, with only one slight change: for any node on which the user has voted, the user's vote shall be used as the Score, rather than the Popular Score. Node for which the user has not voted shall use the Popular Score, until such time as the user has cast a vote.

Given the simple case of two Arguments A1 and A2 in favor of a Claim, and one Argument B1 against:
A1 (Popular Score: 70%, Belief Score: 40%)
A2 (Popular Score: 50%, no Belief Score given)
B1 (Popular Score: 40%, Belief Score 80%)

We can calculate the Popular Truth Score PTS using the Aggregate Strength Score method as:

PTS = 0.5 + 0.5 * (0.73 - 0.4) = 0.865, or 86.5%

However, the Truth Score based on Belief BTS would be:

BTS = 0.5 + 0.5 * (0.40 - 0.8) = 0.30, or 30%

In this case, the Debater's own personal opinion on the subject differs significantly from common opinion, and further Roll-up Scores based on this Claim would reflect this.

It would also be interesting for users to be able "browse" the opinions of other Debaters (while protecting their privacy, of course) in order to gain a deeper understanding of how others think, and what informs their beliefs. Thus, the system should support the possibility of selecting sample votes of other users and "exploring" their votes on related topics. 

In the example above, the user might decide that they would like to see the votes of a user that gave a Score of more than 90% on the Claim. This might then reveal a result as follows:

A1 (Popular Score: 70%, other user's Belief Score: 80%)
A2 (Popular Score: 50%, other user's Belief Score: 90%)
B1 (Popular Score: 40%, other user's Belief Score 0%)
 
Investigating deeper might reveal that this specific user tends to agree very strongly and unquestionably with some public figure, perhaps the subject of the debate, or that they tend to find a certain subject (reflected in Argument B1) as unimportant.

By allowing users to highlight specific Beliefs in this manner, the platform is able to provide the introspection and deep understanding that is our goal.

====3.3.5 Ranking of Arguments.====

One of the most important roles for scoring is to enable the ranking of Arguments, from "best" (strongest or most relevant) to worst. This is, most of all, in support of the Objective:

'''''It should be possible to grasp the principle arguments of a debate in 30 seconds or less'''''

By assigning a Score based on popular or personal opinion, or on the preponderance of facts, it becomes possible to design an interface which highlights the most salient information in a given debate. 

One type of user interface currently under consideration is the possibility of voting by ranking. The ability to manually sort Arguments in order of "best" to "worst", and use this as a mechanism for voting is a compelling possibility. It remains to be decided what such a ranking would mean, however. Would the average user be sophisticated enough to sort ONLY by Relevance, or would the ranking have to be considered its overall Strength, according to how convincing the user considers each Argument to be (and how, then, would one register a Relevance Score for an Argument with a base Claim that is totally false)?

====3.6.1 Who Should Curate?====

====3.6.2 Curation Actions.====

What follows is a guide to the types of actions that a Curator may choose to execute in the effort to maintain the debates canonical and constructive. For those who are familiar with software development, these are analogous to types of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring code refactoring], only for arguments in a debate.

=====3.6.2.1 Fundamental Actions.=====

The following actions are the simplest, most rudimentary actions that are required to keep a debate organized and canonical. Some are actions that only users can do, but the act of creation of new content is part of debating in general.

======3.6.2.1.1 Create Claim or Argument.======

This is the most obvious action required of any debate. It only deserves mention here as it is a required step in some of the more complex actions listed below, including Split Claim and Group Arguments.

======3.6.2.1.2 Delete Claim.======

This is a highly contentious and dangerous action to put in the hands of anyone. The fact that historical forms of the debate can be viewed helps temper the problem, but it remains to be seen whether or not this should be an option at all.

The simplest case, that of a Claim with no Arguments of its own, and no votes, actually makes sense. There's little or no harm done in this case, and can be considered a simple act of housekeeping (a User can always come along and create the Claim a second time).

If a Claim with parent or sub-Arguments gets deleted, it would necessarily require the deletion of those Arguments as well (and then the deletion of their Arguments, and so on), so it makes sense to treat this option with care.

======3.6.2.1.3 Delete Argument.======

This carries the same risks as Delete Claim. However, it makes a little more sense than the latter, in the case that an Argument is created that has absolutely no relevance to the debate whatsoever. Also, since an Argument is merely the connection of one Claim to another (or to an Argument), it would be much easier to recreate the Argument, if necessary.

======3.6.2.1.4 Attribute Enhancements.======

This is the simplest form of curation, involving small changes to the text or attributes of a Claim or an Argument. These changes may include:

* Changing the Title
* Changing the Description
* Changing media elements
* Adding References
* Adding or correcting Context elements

This type of change is not structural, and should not have a major impact on the scoring of the element. As such, there is no need to reset the scores that have been chosen for this element. However, it would probably make sense to send a notification to the contributors when this action is performed.

Given its simplicity, one approach under consideration would be to make this type of enhancement available to average Debaters. In a [https://github.com/bigokro/gruff previous experiment], it was possible for common users to propose a new version of a Title or Description. Debaters could then vote on which of all proposed versions they considered to be the best. The version with the most votes was then the version that would appear to users (it would still be possible to click a tab to see all the proposed versions at once). While simple, and subject to attack by bad-intentioned users (or those wanting to make a joke), it would nevertheless be a way to improve Claim and Argument quality without extra overhead for the Curators. An additional feature to counterbalance could be the option to override and lock a Title or Description by a Curator in order to prevent such attacks.

=====3.6.2.2 Compound Actions.=====

These are actions that could be reproduced with some extra work by a combination of the actions above, but it is recommended that the system support these as explicit options.

======3.6.2.2.1 Merge Duplicates.======

Probably the most common problem in attempting to maintain a canonical debate is the occurrence of duplicate Arguments or Claims. Whether Debaters are misunderstand what has previously been said, are too lazy to read the points that have already been made, or just want to say it in their own words, duplication is rampant in online debates.

Merging is the act of taking two identical Claims or Arguments and unifying them into one. It sounds simple, but would require the following fundamental actions to reproduce:

# Move each of the child Arguments over to one of the two Arguments or Claims (the "Survivor").
# In the case of merging a Claim, for each Argument that uses the non-Survivor as base, create a new Argument identical to it using the Survivor as a base instead. Repeat also for any Arguments attached to those Arguments, and so on.
# Perform any changes to Title or Description as appropriate (note that the history of Attribute Enhancements on the non-Survivor will be lost).
# Delete the Argument or Claim that was not selected as the Survivor

Doing this as a single supported action makes the operation smoother, with less risk of human error. Even so, it has a profound impact on every one of the attributes previously listed:

Unique ID

There are only two reasonable approaches in this case: choose one of the existing IDs, or create a brand new ID. Conceptually, there should be no problem with pre-existing links to one of the entities connecting to the new merged entity. On the other hand, it would be a loss if prior links were broken (although it would be possible to show the old version, and direct the user to the new merged edition). As will become evident in other cases below, it makes sense to choose one of the two entities (the one that has received more "attention") to persist as before, but with the modifications as noted below.

Title and Description

There can be only one of each of these elements. Ideally, the "best' of each should be chosen. If the system was set up to allow the public to vote on multiple proposals of each, then the most voted option across both versions of the entity should be chosen the victor. If not, the Curator performing the merge can be asked to select which of each version they prefer. In the simplest case the Curator or the system may select which of the two versions is the "survivor" (see below), and the Title and Description of that entity will be the one that prevails.

Links and Related Media

These elements are additive in nature. There is no inherent problem in having multiple external links nor media (assuming they are appropriate). In the case of a merge, it would be sufficient to maintain a (unique, if both entities contain the same entry) copy of each. This can then be followed up with an Attribute Enhancement, as described above, should this be desired.

Context

Assuming both merged entities were properly constructed, it should be assumed that their Context elements are identical, or nearly so. If not so, at least in spirit, then the system should not permit the merger at all. Thus, the best solution to this problem is to require that each entity have the same Contexts before a merger can occur. If this requires some Attribute Enhancement Curation prior to the merger, so be it.

Score

The most profound impact upon merger is on the Score of the two entities. Conceptually, no change has been made to either - they are two identical entities that have been expressed in two different ways. However, differences in their attributes (descriptions and links), and differences in the Arguments made for or against them could have an effect on the votes that have been cast so far (see Move Argument below).

There are three possible ways to handle this situation: 

# Merge all the votes (maintain all the previous scores and calculate a new average).
# Maintain only the votes of the survivor.
# Zero out all previous votes.

Until further experimentation has been performed with the platform, it would be unwise to select one over the other. It should be noted that the first option poses a problem when the same Debater has voted on both entities, and given different scores. Regardless of the option chosen, users that have previously voted should be notified of the change.

Arguments Based on Merged Claims

Given that both Claims are identical in nature, any Arguments that have been based on either of them should still be valid under the merged Claim. Thus, the merged version should become the base Claim for all the Arguments involved.

The one edge case here is what happens when both of the merged Claims have an Argument that attacks or defends the same Claim or Argument. In the case that both either attack or defend the target, the merger of the Claim should be performed first, followed by a merger of the Arguments that are based on the newly merged Claim. In the case that they are on opposite sides of the debate, the result depends on the implementation:

* If the system was implemented to treat Arguments that are Pro and Con (see above) as a single entity, the system should merge Scores as discussed above.
* If the system was implemented to maintain two separate copies of Pro and Con versions of an Argument, then the two should be maintained.

Claims upon which Merged Arguments Were Based

Claims aren't affected by the Arguments that use them in debates. There should be no impact to a base Claim under such circumstances. However, Arguments should not be merged unless they both have the same base Claim.

The Target

It doesn't make sense to merge two Arguments unless they are both attacking or defending the same Argument or Claim. There should be no change, and the the merged entity should maintain the Target as before. The only consideration is with how a change to the Score should affect the roll-up Score of the Target. Debaters that had previously voted on the Target should be notified of the change to its Arguments.

Arguments For or Against a Merged Claim or Argument

In principle, the two entities that were merged were identical in nature. As with Arguments that are based on merged Claims, Arguments attacking or defending the merged entities can be preserved, using the merged entity as their new Target. Also similarly, this may trigger a merging of any identical Arguments (those that have the same base Claim), as described above.

Choosing the Survivor

The easiest solution to choosing which entity is the one that survives is to simply ask the Curator to choose. This may, in fact, be the most effective solution as well, since humans may perceive subtleties that an algorithm may not.

If the selection is done algorithmically, then a scoring system should be devised to determine which is the best option to maintain. The calculation should consider the following, according to a yet-to-be-determined system of weighting:

* Did either of the two previously receive Attribute Enhancement curations?
* Which one has the Title and Description with the most votes (if voting is used)?
* Which one has more Score votes?
* Which has the most Arguments?
* Which has the best Arguments?

In general, the number of Arguments and the number of Score votes should be the primary criteria for winner selection.

======3.6.2.2.2 Split Claim.======

Some Claims may be made in such a way that they are really a combination unrelated facts. An exaggerated example might be something like the phrase "You're ugly and you smell bad", which is really the combination of the two Claims "You're ugly" and "You smell bad". A Curator in such a situation would therefore need to make a change such that two Claims are made from the one.

The manual approach would be to use step-by-step modifications to arrive at the final objective:

# Create a new Claim with a Title and Description referring to the second half of the original Claim
# Rename the Title and edit the Description of the original Claim so that they reflect only the first half of the Claim
# Move (see Move Argument below) any parent or child Arguments to the second Claim as appropriate
# Update the Contexts of each Claim to reflect the reduced scope of each new Argument

If this type of operation becomes commonplace and burdensome, the system can facilitate many of the steps with a single tool that uses Context to help automate the process:

# Initiate the process to split the Claim
# Choose a new Title and Description for each
# Let the system choose the new Contexts for each, providing manual help as needed
# Let the system choose according to the new Contexts which Arguments, and which of the Arguments that are based on the old Claim should be associated with each of the new Claims (or both). Provide manual corrections as needed.
# Submit the selections to have the system perform the operations as configured

Score

When the manual approach is used for such an operation, it creates a problem. A new Claim is created with no previous votes, but the old one, which is now only half of its original self, will still maintain its Score. Due to the Move Argument operations, Debaters will be notified of the change, but it will be up to them to alter their vote accordingly.

If the facilitated approach is used, the system should not only notify users, but should also zero out any previous votes on both of the resulting Claims. There is no way to algorithmically determine how the voting will change with enough certainty to try.

======3.6.2.2.3 Split Argument.======

This is not in fact a feature that needs to be supported. Since an Argument is merely the expression of a Claim used to support or attack another Claim or Argument, you cannot have multiple Arguments in a single entity. However, it's possible to create text that appears to be two Arguments in one. In such a case, the proper solution would be to correct the Title and Description such that it is appropriate for the base Claim, and then locate (or create) a Claim for the second half of the Argument and create a new Argument. If there are any child (or parent) Arguments relating to the second half of the Argument, these should then be move (see Move Argument below).

======3.6.2.2.4 Move Argument.======

This is one of the most critical and frequent types of Curation. The idea of a canonical debate, and the idea of separating Arguments into their distinct logical components, is not (yet) a common practice for most people. Our natural instinct is to provide a defense or counter-argument of any kind we are able to conjure, regardless of whether it is relevant or not. This is only made worse by the need to have the last word. Creating a constructive and canonical debate, however, takes careful thought and effort.

When an Argument is made in the wrong place, its impact on the outcome of the debate may be negated due to its irrelevance. This does not mean that it is unimportant, only that it has been used in the wrong Context. The work for the Curator, then, is to find the proper Context for the Argument, and move it there.

Consider a debate over gun control, where the following Claim is being discussed:

''Preventing people with a diagnosis of mental illness from owning firearms does not go far enough to protect the public.''

And the following Argument added as an argument for the Claim:

''The shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had no clinical diagnosis of mental illness.''

While somewhat appropriate for the discussion, it would probably get a rather low Score for Strength based on its low impact (a single example). However, it is highly probable there would be a second Argument on the Claim of the type:

''Only 22 percent of mass murderers could be considered mentally ill prior to their crime.''

For a Curator in this situation, the task is simple: move the more specific example away from the Claim over the more general Argument as a supporting argument.

It could be implemented using the Fundamental Actions listed as part of the Merge Claims action:

# Create a new Argument with the new Target as its destination.
# "Move" (in the way being described here) any sub-Arguments over to the new Argument.
# Delete the old Argument.

Especially for an Argument with a lot of debate all its own, that would be a tiring and risky task, and history would be lost with the delete action. This feature should be implemented as a single action. Here's how such a move would impact the attributes:

Unique ID

There is no need to change the ID of the Argument, unless the format used for IDs is a unique combination of the base Claim, and the Target (which is now being changed).

Title and Description

In general, no changes would be necessary in this case. There will probably be some minor exceptions.

Links and Related Media

No changes are necessary.

Score

As mentioned above, one of the reasons for moving an Argument is to make it more relevant, or to give it more impact. This means that done properly, Move Argument should result in an increase in its Strength. Unfortunately, there is no way to definitively calculate by how much (nor to tell voters how their votes should change without their input). Therefore, the best solution is to zero out the Score votes, and notify the voters that they'll have to give a new opinion on the subject.

Base Claim

Moving an Argument should have no impact on its base Claim.

The Targets

The original Target (Claim or Argument) will be losing one of its Arguments. It shouldn't directly affect the (voted) Score of the Target to make a radical difference. The current assumption (prior to significant testing) is that the votes should be left undisturbed. Of course, the roll-up Score will be affected mathematically by the change.

The new Target will be gaining a new Argument. However, it will be an Argument without any initial Score. As with the creation of a brand new Argument, there should be no immediate impact on the roll-up of the new Target until voting re-commences.

Arguments For or Against a Moved Argument

This is a complicated issue to consider. Some Arguments may still be as relevant as before, such as:

''This is only a single anecdote.''

However, recall that the purpose of moving the Argument in the first place was essentially to increase its Relevance by placing it in its proper place. In the case of the high school shooter argument, this meant very slightly increasing its impact rather than its relevance. 

Consider this much clearer example regarding ice and snow sports preferences:

''Americans prefer downhill skiing over other winter sports''

And the counter-argument:

''Residents of Minneapolis play ice hockey more than any other winter sport.''

Suppose, then, that this Argument is moved below a second Argument:

''The population of Minnesota prefers ice hockey over downhill skiing.''

What, then to do with this sub-Argument?

''Minneapolis is only 0.1% of the population of the United States''

The sub-Argument not only changes in terms of its impact, it no longer seems relevant. 

Given these conditions, one of the following would be recommended:

# Delete all the sub-Arguments (along with their votes).
# Allow the Curator to choose which sub-Arguments should be deleted (and set the Scores of the remaining to zero).
# Don't allow this action for Arguments that already have sub-Arguments.

======3.6.2.2.5 Group Arguments.======

The examples given above for Move Argument reveal another possibility: what should be done when there are multiple Arguments all related to the same basic point? For example, imagine these Arguments for the debate I should get a diamond embedded in my tooth:

''Study A shows that 3 out of 4 people prefer diamond-embedded teeth to gold-capped.''
''Study B shows that in Utah, diamond-embedded teeth are on the rise.''
''Study C shows that gold-capped teeth are still king.''

Under such circumstances, it may make sense to group these Arguments under a single heading, rather than leaving them on their own.

''Diamond-embedded teeth are more popular than ones that are gold-capped.''

This new statement would be used as a single Argument in the debate, making it easier to understand. The old Arguments would then become sub-Arguments of the new Argument, but there's a subtle point to be made here: This new Argument requires a base Claim of its own.

Grouping Arguments, then, consists of the following Fundamental and Compound Actions:

# Create a new Argument, with a new base Claim
# Move each of the existing Arguments to become Arguments for or against the new Claim

One thing to keep in mind, is that for some subjects, the most popular arguments are in fact significantly overlapping with each other. So if we always just regrouped, we may end up regrouping some arguments deeper down where (casual reader) people won't see them. This has some negativity in that if we link people to the discussion, they may be confused by that half of the points they find convincing were moved to a deeper level, making them think the content added is not fairly representing their side. If they searched, they would find it, but many people wouldn't try that on their first visits. I'm not saying this is a critical issue necessarily, just bringing it up for consideration.
(The overlap rating solution has a similar problem in that it pushes arguments down in the ordering, so it doesn't solve it either. Just bringing the subject up.) (edited)

=======3.6.2.2.5.1 Heuristics for Grouping Arguments.=======

TODO: establish a list of guidelines

* Arguments that can be grouped as proving a broader premise should be regrouped under a new claim, and that single claim used as an argument in the parent

.... something about specific to general (e.g. Study A, Study B, Study C... should be regrouped as "Studies show")

======3.6.2.2.6 Clone Claim.======

In the course of a discussion, it is common to see the main subject of the debate evolve over time. An extreme example of this is the informal logical fallacy known as Moving the Goalposts. However, even (or especially) in the case of a constructive discourse, the original debate may require some refinement in order to come to a reasonable conclusion on the subject.

Consider the debate regarding dental fashion described above:

''Diamond-embedded teeth are more popular than ones that are gold-capped.''

Suppose that during the course of the debate, it becomes clear that while diamond embedding is obviously clear when it comes to the 65 and older crowd, teenagers clearly prefer gold-capped teeth. The canonical claim above would naturally have mixed results, with an outcome of, perhaps, a 47% Truth Score. While that is interesting to observe, it becomes more interesting to look at each of the more specific cases on their own:

''Diamond-embedded teeth are more popular than ones that are gold-capped for people 65 years of age and older.''
''Diamond-embedded teeth are less popular than ones that are gold-capped for teenagers.''

Each of those Claims would bear the most relevant parts of the more generalized debate, and have, perhaps, a Truth Score closer to 70% (for example). It would then be interesting to create new debates with even more specifics, such as:

''Diamond-embedded teeth are more popular than ones that are gold-capped for people 65 years of age and older on the Island of Tasmania for the period of 2010 through 2018.''

And so on. The act of Curation, then, consists of:

# Identifying the opportunity to create a more specific Claim from the original Claim.
# Creating the new Claim with a new, more specific Title and Description.
# Adding or modifying the Context for the more restricted case. 
# Creating new Arguments for those Arguments that are still relevant considering the new Context. 
# Creating a new Argument with the new Claim as its base for use in the more general Argument.

The Compound Curation Action can make the process simpler like so:

# Identify the opportunity.
# Choose Clone Claim, and select the new Context, Title and Description as appropriate.
# Offer a menu to choose which Arguments would still be relevant in the new Claim (matching Context could help automate this process).
# Automatically create the Argument linking the new Claim to the general one.

Cloning could also support creating a more general Argument:

===3.10 Problem Solving.===

The first phase of Gruff will not focus on more complex questions, the kind that make up discussions around legislation. While Gruff is excellent for debating specific points of a proposed solution, its structure is inadequate for this situation.

* Problem description
* Debate whether or not the problem needs a solution at all
* Different proposed solutions
* Scoring solutions vs. trade offs
* Governance: cost, time for implementation, when to review success
* Voting

it’s just a different structure and a different process: problem solving is not the same thing as debating something that is true/false
here’s a very easy example:

kwiesmueller [2:05 PM]
But, I am not even sure, if what I mentioned here is even a "problem" but I wanted to kick this thought in from the side, as all philosophical thinking and solutions about debating might be useless if we lose the focus on how, where and by whom decisions are made in the near and distant future

timothy.high [2:05 PM]
* How do we stop terrorist attacks on the U.S.?
Solution: Don’t let ANYONE inside the country
Solution: Don’t let anyone from principally Muslim countries inside the country
Solution: Don’t let anyone that is known to be Muslim inside the country
Solution: Let anyone inside, but do a thorough body and luggage check of everyone that tries to enter
Solution: Let anyone in, but monitor all communications
and so on….
then, discussing these options, you start to come to some general conclusions:
* Not letting people in is bad for the economy
* Not letting people in is bad for human rights (esp. for refugees)
* Surveillance is bad for privacy
* Not doing anything will put U.S. (or whatever country’s) lives are risk
If you try to do this as a dialectic, you get something like this:
— Don’t let anyone into the country
Pro: Saves U.S. lives
Pro: Easy to implement
Con: Bad for the economy
Con: Bad for human rights
— Don’t do anything
Pro: Easy to implement
Pro: Good for the economy
Pro: Good for human rights
Con: Doesn’t save human lives
The (extreme) point is that it doesn’t fit into a dialectic. You get hundreds of proposals, and for each one you more or less repeat the same arguments over and over: economy would suffer in this case; be good in that case. This one kind of works, this one doesn’t work so well…
So, you need a different structure: you need to list explicitly the trade offs that you care about (economy, safety, human rights, privacy…), then score each proposal against each of the criteria (with, of course voting and debates)
All this is to say - debating a single claim is a good place to start, even if the end goal is something different.
